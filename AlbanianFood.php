                    <p><cite>Flija</cite> also known as fli or flija, is a dish in Albanian cuisine and in Balkan cuisine generally. It consists of multiple crepe-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream. The name translates to "sacrifice".
                    March 18 is recognized as "Flia Day" in which families invite their relatives for preparing and eating Flia.[citation needed]
					Flija requires very simple ingredients: flour, water, butter, yogurt and salt. The main ingredients (flour, water and salt) are mixed together until they become like pancake batter. Layers of batter are baked using a sač which is a spherical metal lid used for baking.
